Hey kids! Did you miss me? I sure missed seeing you guys! That’s why I made this itty-bitty little old-fashiioned BLOG where I can longpost about you guys without fear of the Capybara! Despite being permabanned (for good?) I can still log in and stalk the forums! And let me tell ya, you guys have got some REAL kneeslappers! I think my favorite part is when you guys accuse each other of being me :!marseysmug3: and I LOVE LOVE LOVE using one of my alts to join in the fray and accuse y’all of being me :3

Now, in regards to all of the DRAMA that I’ve missed!
- @d:Lappland I’m so pround of you for successfully wrestling back control from the evil @AuntyAbortion! Love ya <3
- @d:ticktocktrain I know I kinda ignored you, I was having a really busy past few weeks, it was a PITA. But long story short I don’t think your annoying or anything! Indeed I find you quite valid :marseytransplushie2:
- @d:A unfortunately it indeed turn out to be a nothingburger. It’s a shame that you still banned me over it though! I would have had to find another exploit in order to execute JS, but I did have some attack vectors in mind. Probably was theoretically possible, but I don’t have that kind of time.

Again, I can still log in, see pings, etc. I just can’t modify the database in any way. Anyways this was just a brief little update post for when I created the blog, I’ll probably blog a lot more in the future :3
